     * Uses Viola and Jones HaarCascades detector to detect 2D features.
     * Provide initial detection range with d used to scale how closely the camera
     * is positioned to the face based on the detected distance between the eyes e
     * with the distance formula rng * e/d.
     *
     * Provide centre point of model to focus on initially.
     * Returns matrix specifying how model is transformed from its correctly
     * detected orientation based on detection of eyes and calculation of vertex
     * position eigen vectors around the eyes to estimate orientation
     * (detected alignment is additive with model's current transform).
     *
     * If the zero matrix is returned, call error() to return the error msg.
     * Note that the transformation point is set as the midpoint between the
     * detected eyes (which is almost certainly behind the surface of the face).
